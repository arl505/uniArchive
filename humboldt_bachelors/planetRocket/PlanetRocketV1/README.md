# Planet Rocket

This is my personal copy of the repository for V1 of a previous web application for Planet Rocket that I worked on.

[V1](https://pr1.arlevin.org) utilizes a LEMP (Linux, NGINX, MariaDB, and PHP) stack built with the Laravel framework while

[V2](https://pr2.arlevin.org) utilizes a more modern MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js) stack.
