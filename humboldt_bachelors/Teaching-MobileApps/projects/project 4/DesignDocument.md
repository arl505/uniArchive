# Tunnel Game
This PA served, firstly, as an introduction to Unity programming and development for me, and secondly, as the beginning of developing my Final Project. Being my first time using Unity, I created a rather simple game. This application is a single level tunnel game that moves the player (a ball) based on input from phone movement using the accelerometer. This application provides the foundation for what I hope will eventually be one of the more complex games within my Game Suite. This game works regardless of how it is used. In other words, it is thoroughly protected against malicious intent and will work regardless of how it used. Upon launching the application, the game will immediately begin with the user seeing a ball moving through a long tunnel. The objective of the game is to make it to the end of the tunnel without hitting anything head on. Upon colliding with an obstacle, the game restarts. Upon making it to the end of the tunnel the game also restarts.     
     
## System Design    
**Device Requirements:**    
Accelerometer      
Minimum Android API Level: 4.1         
Target Android API Level: 5.1      
APK Size (size on phone): 22 MB      

This is a single page application. In order to view the complete operation of the application, simply install and launch it.    

## Usage
This application allows the user to play a simple tunnel game. To play:
1) Launch the app     
2) Tilt phone to move the ball    
3) Avoid any obstacles, colliding head on with anything will restart the game
4) Once one has made it to the end, one collides with the wall to restart.
