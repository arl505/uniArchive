# Lab 1 - *Twitter Welcome Clone*

**Twitter Welcome Clone** is an android app that mimicks the first few pages of the Twitter Android app.

Submitted by: **Alec Levin**

Time spent: **5** hours spent in total

**You can put this application on your Android device by downloading [this APK file](app-release-unsigned.apk) to your device.**

## User Stories 

The following **required** functionality is completed:
* [x] Create a new android project (minSDK 16) and choose to create a "Empty Activity"
* [x] Recreate one chosen login screen as closely as possible while using android views and layouts
* [x] Use actual views, text fields, layouts, buttons 
* [x] Clone the structure and layout of the screen
* [x] Play around with RelativeLayout
* [x] When pressing action buttons, hook up the button event to toast 

The following functionality was not required, but I added anyways:
* [x] Explore a multi-page app using multiple activities and a new Intent.
* [x] Lots of work exploring layout options to get the register page to mirror the actual Twitter register page.
